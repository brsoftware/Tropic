# Tropic

*Craft your developer journey with Tropic.*

*The icon is designing :P*

## Features

Tropic has many useful features that you will also find in those modern and robust code editors, including but not limited to the following:

* Due to the compatibility Qt has guaranteed, Tropic supports Microsoft Windows and macOS. Soon GNU/Linux and (probably) BSD will also be supported. See the [supported platforms of the Qt application development framework](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/supported-platforms.html) for a more detailed explanation.
* Though unstable (we're in the beta-testing processes), you could open a document in multiple windows, in multiple tabs, or if you wish - split the tab into two or more, mimicking the [professionalism of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/custom-layout).
* You can find in multiple files, or find in a single file via regex. Regex is undeniably the best utility and the best pseudo-language in handling plain text.
* Convert the three mainstream ends-of-lines seamlessly (precisely to, for among Windows, Unix and Macintosh endings the latter one is virtually abandoned).
* Rectangular selection. That's what you do when you want to select an array of lines neatly and pressing `ALT` on most industrial code editors.
* As an extension, virtual space is supported. When you extend your rectangular selection to a non-existent position (e.g. extend such selection from a short line's end to a longer line's end), Tropic assumes that there are some space due to convenience. Smart it is, you could disable it anytime at the menus.
* Supports the following programming languages (that cover 99% of the programming world nowadays): ActionScript, ASP, AviSynth, GNU/Bash (Shell Script), Batch (Windows `cmd`), BASIC (Blitz BASIC, Pure BASIC, Free BASIC), C, C++, C++/Qt, C#, CMake, CoffeeScript, CSS, D, Diff, Fortran (Fixed and Free), HTML, IDL (Microsoft), Intel Hex, Java, JavaScript, JSON, LaTeX, Lua, Makefile, Markdown (Commonmark dialect), MASM, Matlab, NASM, GNU/Octave, Pascal, Perl, PHP, GNU/PO, PostScript, POV, `.gitignore`, `.gitmodules`, `.ini`, `.conf` etc., Python (2 and 3), QML (Qt), QSS (CSS/Qt), Qt `.ui` files, Ruby, Spice, SQL, S-Record, TCL, Tektronix Hex, TeX, Verilog, VHDL, XML and YAML. More are coming on their ways.
* Matching the brace, auto-indentation, auto-completion, code-folding, etc. that you will be seeing in most of the industrial-standard editors.

I shall thank the mighty Scintilla, the attested Qt and the strong open source communities to grand our project such powerful features. But for the well-known frameworks and the altruist nature of the communities, Tropic would not have been so powerful.

## Name

I hope that every developers will be as energetic and enthusiastic as the people living in tropical regions. They do not worry too much; and I hope it if we all could code grinning without agonized by debugging. That - potentially - leads to the simplistic nature of our first project.

## How to build by yourself (in both simple steps and simple English)

1. Download [Qt](https://qt.io).
2. Open Qt Creator.
3. Open the main `CMakeLists.txt` via Qt Creator.
4. Select Qt 5 or Qt 6. Note that only versions Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.8 are attested; support for other versions are uncertain as Qt sometimes introduces drastical changes to (even) a minor version upgrade.
5. Click build.
6. Wait. Enjoy. (If error occurs, don't be upset, it's our fault not yours nor your computer's, and please dash to GitHub issues - in fact, right next to here - and report it. Bear in mind that this is a beta version and it is not for real-world uses, and may cause troubles. What do you do is actually helping us to eradicate or at least minimalize all errors and make Tropic grow stronger and more robust.)
